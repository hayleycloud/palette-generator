# Mathematical Palette Generator
This project is a simple yet flexible palette generator for creating palettes for sprite-based graphic design, particularly aimed at pixel spriting platforms such as Aseprite.

The idea is to allow the user to specify and stack dynamic gradients, with the palette shown live as the properties are modified, so that efficient and precise palettes can be computed and generated quickly for use.

It's programmed in TypeScript and runs purely in the browser. There are no dependencies required - only a browser that supports JavaScript ECMAScript 2017, which is every major browser by this point.

Both the TypeScript source files and the compiled JS file are provided.

They say to build software that you actually want to use yourself, which fully applied here. So if it seems a bit barebones or something seems amiss, that's why - it's a personal project at the end of the day.
